## Description
Develop an application that would allow users to select items from the meals and drinks menu and add them to the basket. 
When the order is ready, the app will notify the customer, by sending a voice message on their phone, an SMS or an email.
The user can leave their name and choose whether they want to receive order confirmation via phone, SMS or email.

## Installation
To use this app, the used needs to install the dependencies below:.\
[Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) Run *npx-create-react-app* in Terminal
[React route DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
